 * Everything plugin-specific comes from plugin.json (found by ./manifest.mjs), so this works unchanged
 * for any plugin: the ZIP name from id + version + dwcVersion, the project link from homepage, and the SBC note from
 * sbcRequired. A docs/Installation-Configuration.md in the repository is linked if present.
 * The DWC details come from the CI build environment (the release workflow sets these after it checks
 * out DuetWebControl), so it also reads sensibly when run locally.
